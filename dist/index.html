      <p>When you get lost in your imaginatory vagueness, your foresight will become a nimble vagrant.
        You ever roasted doughnuts?These kind of things only happen for the first time once.You gotta
        go through it to see there ain't nothing to it.It's good to yell at people and tell people that
        you're from Tennesee, so that way you'll be safe.

      <p>The best way to communicate is compatible. Compatible communication is listening with open
        ears and an open mind, and not being fearful or judgemental about what you're hearing.Did you
        feel that? Look at me - I'm not out of breath anymore!These kind of things only happen for the
        first time once.
